[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:00 AM] <ogzy>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:09 AM] <ogzy>	let me tell what i study last night
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:15 AM] <l4rry>	sure
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:18 AM] <ogzy>	i made a plan i my mind
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:25 AM] <ogzy>	e general design indeed
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:32 AM] <ogzy>	you mentioned me about the timeline issue
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:41 AM] <ogzy>	http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeline/
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:02:43 AM] <ogzy>	i checked it
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:05 AM] <ogzy>	at stackoverflow, some people mentioned it as a problomatic library
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:13 AM] <ogzy>	consuming so much resource
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:20 AM] <ogzy>	hard to handle errors
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:39 AM] <l4rry>	ok, no pb, i was not recommending any specific anyway
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:42 AM] <ogzy>	i checked the bugtracker and it seems they still maintain it
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:46 AM] <ogzy>	i found a nother library
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:03:53 AM] <ogzy>	http://timeglider.com/jquery/
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:04:34 AM] <ogzy>	lets check the example at the page and image it is written SMTP, HTTP, FTP what ever 
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:04:49 AM] <ogzy>	with icons red or green
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:04:50 AM] <l4rry>	interesting
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:04:57 AM] <ogzy>	green is = ok this is a normal HTTP
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:05:05 AM] <ogzy>	red is = http but not at standart port
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:05:20 AM] <ogzy>	and there may be blue marks for unknown traffic
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:05:30 AM] <l4rry>	i don't see smtp, http, ftp ...
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:05:41 AM] <ogzy>	i said imagine :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:05:51 AM] <l4rry>	:) i imagine
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:06 AM] <l4rry>	i like the idea
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:24 AM] <ogzy>	after reading the pcap and analyzing it the main visualization will be this timeline
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:36 AM] <ogzy>	i will see the traffic 
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:40 AM] <ogzy>	i click on one of them
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:48 AM] <ogzy>	it will open me a page with details
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:52 AM] <ogzy>	like malware results
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:06:58 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:19 AM] <ogzy>	i am planning to use treemap at this page with scatterplost also
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:30 AM] <ogzy>	treemaps will display, byte size per protocol
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:38 AM] <l4rry>	any example?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:38 AM] <ogzy>	not scatter sorry
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:49 AM] <ogzy>	http://mbostock.github.com/d3/ex/treemap.html
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:07:50 AM] <ogzy>	treemap
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:08:01 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:08:38 AM] <ogzy>	and not scatter sorry parallelcoordinate
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:08:46 AM] <ogzy>	it will give me the port based communication
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:08:56 AM] <ogzy>	http://exposedata.com/parallel/veggie/
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:02 AM] <ogzy>	or http://bl.ocks.org/1341281
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:06 AM] <ogzy>	lets check the last one
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:19 AM] <ogzy>	imagine it is written the IP numbers
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:32 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:35 AM] <ogzy>	instead of economy, cylinders, ...
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:46 AM] <ogzy>	and the numbers on the lines will ports
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:09:48 AM] <l4rry>	the 1st one, exposedata looks pretty good
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:01 AM] <ogzy>	yes i can make something like that too
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:02 AM] <l4rry>	yep
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:18 AM] <ogzy>	the idea will be, ok i have http on 8080, ftp on 21
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:30 AM] <ogzy>	or there is a port scanning
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:32 AM] <ogzy>	:)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:39 AM] <l4rry>	yes
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:10:43 AM] <ogzy>	parallel coordinates are nice to visualizae thme
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:11:07 AM] <ogzy>	and at treemaps, oh there is huge communication occured at port 21, ok it is ftp, for ex
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:11:35 AM] <ogzy>	these will be my first aim till the midterm :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:11:47 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:11:49 AM] <ogzy>	at least i plan to make them work for some protocols
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:11:59 AM] <ogzy>	and there will be a scatterplot part
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:06 AM] <ogzy>	http://mbostock.github.com/protovis/ex/dot.html
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:19 AM] <ogzy>	it will display the overall protocols
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:40 AM] <l4rry>	like what? what is x and y and size?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:45 AM] <ogzy>	x will be port number, y will be the count
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:47 AM] <l4rry>	and color
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:52 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:12:56 AM] <ogzy>	the circles will be tcp udp ftp
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:13:11 AM] <ogzy>	their size will be propotional to count
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:13:27 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:01 AM] <ogzy>	if there is traffic at a port that is not general
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:06 AM] <l4rry>	so for all that to work, most importantly would be to disect the pcap and extract the relevant info
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:14 AM] <ogzy>	yes exatly
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:36 AM] <ogzy>	if the port and protocol are not matching, like 8888 at htttp the color will be red for x
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:44 AM] <ogzy>	for x = for ex
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:14:57 AM] <ogzy>	this will be second issue after midterm
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:15:30 AM] <ogzy>	and we will be looking at the web interface and saying ok lets add this feature, most probably
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:15:45 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:15:59 AM] <ogzy>	any questions?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:17:16 AM] <l4rry>	not for the moment
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:17:41 AM] <ogzy>	i will start with writing parsers, keeping the information
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:17:57 AM] <ogzy>	will take into consideration some protocols at the first sight
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:18:00 AM] <ogzy>	visualizae them
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:18:07 AM] <ogzy>	also a malware plugin
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:18:17 AM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:18:38 AM] <ogzy>	if i can set this work out, cuckoo plugin will be also possible
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:18:40 AM] <l4rry>	what's your background / strenght?

[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:19:56 AM] <ogzy>	did you read my proposal? :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [11:20:10 AM] <l4rry>	not yet actually, will do now

[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:30:19 PM] <l4rry>	i think you should probably replace that the project is to replace netwitness (though it's true)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:30:52 PM] <l4rry>	i was trying to play with it now but it does not work (can't import - size = 0)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:32:27 PM] <l4rry>	btw, i applied as mentor, pending approval
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:34:45 PM] <l4rry>	did you see http://netwitness.com/resources/videos/investigator-tutorial-1-overview-navigation ?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:45:07 PM] <ogzy>	checking now
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:49:53 PM] <ogzy>	so you suggest me to update the proposal?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:51:33 PM] <l4rry>	at least to remove the "For the long term, the aim will be the open alternative for http://netwitness.com/products-services/investigator" 
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:52:02 PM] <l4rry>	though it's indeed the aim
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:52:44 PM] <ogzy>	ok i am updating
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:52:56 PM] <l4rry>	thx
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:53:58 PM] <ogzy>	also adding comments what we talked so far
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:54:07 PM] <ogzy>	like visualization parts, dpkt usage
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:54:41 PM] <l4rry>	ok
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:55:30 PM] <l4rry>	one question, for you, it it a one-off or you plan to continue working on it even after gsoc?
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [12:59:49 PM] <ogzy>	as i said at my proposal, i would like to continue developing it
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:01:23 PM] <l4rry>	good :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:02:16 PM] <ogzy>	there can be many improvements at the project
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:02:28 PM] <ogzy>	I even think becoming a mentor of it at the following years :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:02:30 PM] <l4rry>	yes, exactly
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:05:10 PM] <l4rry>	if you look in the options of netwitness, in the process section, you can find what they capture/store by default
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:06:20 PM] <ogzy>	they keep the header information :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:06:33 PM] <ogzy>	which you dont want :)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:07:36 PM] <ogzy>	basic information about the traffic like IP (geo location also), port, file information carried are mentioned
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:07:54 PM] <l4rry>	well, it's not I don't want and you said in proposal:
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:07:56 PM] <l4rry>	I am planning to use Scapy/Dpkt to handle pcap files and get the header information. I plan to save as much information as possible to the database. The payload will be saved also for malware analysis. 
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:08:18 PM] <ogzy>	ok, i mean the displaying information part
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:08:55 PM] <ogzy>	not yet another pcapr but i better display every usefull information for the packets
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:09:16 PM] <ogzy>	netwitness have search
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:09:29 PM] <l4rry>	yes, exactly, useful info
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:17:32 PM] <ogzy>	updated
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:17:43 PM] <ogzy>	also added a comment what we talked
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:18:01 PM] <l4rry>	good
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [01:58:43 PM] <l4rry>	http://gutterchurl.blogspot.com/ <-- some more tools to compete with (and get good ideas from them) ;)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:10:27 PM] <ogzy>	checking
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:11:07 PM] <l4rry>	and besides pcapr, here is another repository to test our tools later https://www.openpacket.org/capture/by_category?category=Malicious
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:18:47 PM] <l4rry>	for each decoded/parsed content, we could have a summary table like: http://www.xplico.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/xwi_emails_list.png (for collected emails)
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:19:06 PM] <l4rry>	or http://www.xplico.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/xwi_http_list.png
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:22:22 PM] <l4rry>	and by command line, some ideas: http://www.netresec.com/?page=Blog&month=2011-03&post=Command-line-Network-Forensics-with-NetworkMinerCLI
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:32:27 PM] <l4rry>	http://www.netresec.com/?page=SplitCap --> http://sourceforge.net/projects/spid/ --> SPID Statistical Protocol IDentification
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:32:29 PM] <l4rry>	A proof-of-concept application of the Statistical Protocol IDentification (SPID) algorithm. SPID can detect the application layer protocol (layer 7) by analysing flow (packet sizes etc.) and payload statistics (byte values etc.) from pcap files.
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:38:16 PM] <l4rry>	ok, ogzy i need to go
[Friday, April 06, 2012] [02:38:35 PM] <l4rry>	if you have any question/comment, feel free to send me emails
