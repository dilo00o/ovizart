Installation

* Install zc.buildout:
At Ubuntu this is done via the command below

$ sudo apt-get install python-zc.build

* Run the buildout command to initialize and install the requirements

$ cp buildout.cfg.org buildout.cfg
$ python bootstrap.py
$ buildout2.7

* install mongodb server
$ sudo apt-get install mongodb-server
You may test the mongodb running my writing mongo to he command line
it you see an shell like below then you may continue with bro installation

$ mongo
MongoDB shell version: 2.0.4
connecting to: test

Requirements for Bro installation

$ sudo apt-get install libmagic-dev libgeoip-dev libpcap-dev libssl-dev libncurses5-dev g++ bison flex cmake swig2.0 make gcc g++ python-dev swig zlib1g-dev
$ ./configure --enable-debug
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ cd /usr/local/bro/bin
$ sudo broctl
$ install
$ start
$ stop
$ check
$ exit
$ /usr/local/bro/bin/bro -C -r pcap_fille.name should be working

* Bro is used both for protocol detection and TCP reassembly. To let Bro handle assemble the contents, a file should be changed. If you installed Bro to /usr/local/bro/ then edit the file /usr/local/bro/share/bro/base/protocols/conn/contents.bro as below

## If this variable is set to ``T``, then all contents of all connections
## will be		extracted.
const default_extract = T &redef;

* make a directory named "uploads" where the setting.py file is. 

$ mkdir uploads
$ chown a+w uploads

* tshark is required for an alternative method to detect application layer protocols where bro fails
$ sudo apt-get install tshark

* If you got backend errors like "django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: 'django_mongodb_engine' isn't an available database backend."
install the django-mongodb backend manually

$ pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/django-nonrel
$ pip install hg+https://bitbucket.org/wkornewald/djangotoolbox
$ pip install git+https://github.com/django-nonrel/mongodb-engine


Django projects requires a table creation first

$ bin/django syncdb

The project uses hachoir Python library, install them also

$ sudo apt-get install python-hachoir-* (i should add this part to the buildout configuration also)

	* to handle smtp, it is required to install tcpflow. After checking the results of Bro and Tcpflow, for smtp, the created flows files seem more manageable.
	$ sudo apt-get install tcpflow
